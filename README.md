# Whirligig

> Please write an app which uses RxSwift, aggregates data from sensors (like gyroscope), gets system info and displays it. No fancy UI is expected, but having good UX would be nice.

## Running the app

Open `Whirligig.xcodeproj` and allow for 3rd party dependancies to download with SwiftPM.

There are two schemes:
* `Whirligig` - run
* `Whirligig-mock` -
